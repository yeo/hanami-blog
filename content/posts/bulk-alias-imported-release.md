Today we release "bulk alias import" which enable you create alias on
multiple domains that you own all at a time with out manually adding one
by one

## How to import or create multiple alias all at a time

Simply head to **Bulk Import** > **Bulk alias** to start use it or visit
[https://app.mailwip.com/domains/bulk/alias](https://app.mailwip.com/domains/bulk/alias)
to manage it

From there, the system will guide you through the process.

Below is an example.

![Bulk import alias](/blog/hotlink-ok/bulk-alias1.png "How to
use bulk alias to create multiple alias all at a time")

Here, getopty.com and miso.is are my domain. I want to forward a few
alias to support@mailwip.com. I can enter a list as below

```
alice@getopty.com,support@mailwip.com
bob@miso.is,support@mailwip.com
ruby@miso.is,support@mailwip.com
finance@miso.is,finance@mailwip.com
```

Upon clicking create, all of alias will be created and setup. If you
have question, hit us on the chat.
