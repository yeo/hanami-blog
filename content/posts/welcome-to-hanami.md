# Why

Every time I tried to start a company or a project, I needed an email to
associate email to us. Setting up a full mail suite requires time,
effort and commitment. I just need a very easy and intuitive way with a
few clicks to give me ability of receiving email to my domain.

On the other hand, it's great to have email tailored to our name or our
personal identity instead of trying to be creative for an email address
that is still available on a public service like Gmail.

Using your own domain also gives you a short and easy way to remember the 
email address.

I built hanami.run so that everyone can have an email address with their
own domain name.

But email is hard, and running your own mail server is not a quick job. We 
can use a public and expensive service like GSuite and we still have to deal
with their bloated UI given they have to support too many different use
cases and their target is the enteprise customer.

I built hanami to give you an easy solution, just a few click and within
seconds you should be able to see email hit your domains.

# What

At our core, Hanami is an email forwarding service. We aim to have
better visibility into what happens with your emails, why emails won't
deliver, fast delivery time and building workflow around email with
webhook.

For example, our [dev channel](https://hanami.run/channel/devnews) is built with
our API.

On top of that, we know that receiving email is half of problem, people
want to send out email from their own domain too, so we also offer SMTP
services.

# The future

At the same time, we like to make email more fun. We are commited to
build tools that help you process email easily. Your banks don't have an
API to help you build a real-time activity tracker? Just use email.

Want to have comment on a static site? Just send an email.

Stay tuned while we build and open source those components.

With that being said, let's give [hanami](https://hanami.run) a try to
have a unique email address powered by your very own domain.
